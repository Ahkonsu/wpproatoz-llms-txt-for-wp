A WordPress plugin that generates an AI-friendly `llms.txt` file and Markdown versions of posts, optimizing your site for Large Language Models (LLMs).

---

## Overview

The **LLMs.txt for WP** plugin makes your WordPress site ready for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Forked from the original [llms-txt-for-wp](https://github.com/WP-Autoplugin/llms-txt-for-wp) by BalÃ¡zs Piller, this updated version adds robust security, performance enhancements, and modern WordPress compatibility. It generates an `llms.txt` file with structured, machine-readable content and supports Markdown versions of posts/pages via `.md` URLs.

Developed by [WPProAtoZ](https://wpproatoz.com), this plugin is perfect for enhancing AI-driven discoverability while maintaining performance and security.

## Testing
- **llms.txt Output**: Visit `https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt` and verify content includes the selected page or posts grouped by post types (e.g., `Posts`, `Pages`, `TestingThings`) and selected categories (e.g., `Interviews`) with their descriptions as h4 headings. Ensure the `Posts` section includes unfiltered posts when specific categories are selected. Confirm `.md` URLs use post slugs only (e.g., `wish-it-where-simple.md`).
- **Markdown Output**: Enable Markdown support, then append `.md` to a post/page URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/wish-it-where-simple.md` for custom post types) and confirm correct Markdown formatting.
- **Settings**: Test all admin settings (page selection, post types, categories, limit, Markdown support). Verify selecting a specific category deselects "All Categories" and `llms.txt` reflects selected categories with descriptions.
- **Caching**: Update settings or posts, visit `llms.txt`, and confirm cache updates correctly. Check for admin notices on cache issues.
- **Uninstallation**: Delete the plugin and confirm `llms_txt_settings` and `llms_txt_cache` are removed from the database.
